### Project Outline: JavaScript Password Generator

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to create a web application that enables employees to generate a random password based on selected criteria. The application will feature a responsive user interface and will be powered by JavaScript code.

# Technical Requirements
The password should include special characters from the OWASP Foundation's list of password special characters.
The password length should be at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters.
The user should be prompted for password criteria, including the length of the password and the character types to include (lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters).
The user's input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected.
The password should be generated and either displayed in an alert or written to the page.

# User Stories
As an employee with access to sensitive data, I want to generate a random password that meets certain criteria so that I can create a strong password that provides greater security.
As a user, I want to be presented with a series of prompts for password criteria so that I can select which criteria to include in the password.
As a user, I want to be able to choose the length of the password between 8 and 128 characters.
As a user, I want to be able to select which character types to include in the password (lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters).
As a user, I want to see the generated password displayed in an alert or written to the page.

# Acceptance Criteria
The application should satisfy all the acceptance criteria outlined in the prompt.
The application should be deployed at a live URL and load without errors.
The application's user experience should be intuitive and easy to navigate.
The application's user interface should be clean and polished.
The application should resemble the mock-up provided in the prompt.
The repository should have a unique name and follow best practices for file structure and naming conventions.
The repository should contain multiple descriptive commit messages and a quality readme file with a description, screenshot, and link to the deployed application.

# Deployment
The final product will be deployed at a live URL and the URL of the GitHub repository will be submitted.

# Review
For review, the URL of the deployed application and the URL of the GitHub repository with a unique name and readme file will be submitted.
